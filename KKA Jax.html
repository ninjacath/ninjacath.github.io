			<h4>Jax is a purple teifling, with shark-like tail. Raised on the seas, she's well versed in the world of pirates. She runs the show and won't let anybody else take control.</h4>
			<h4>she carries a very few things. Most of them basic pirate needs; a compass, a sword, and the keys to the brig. However, She also wears a golden amulet but nobody's actually seen what it looks like.</h4>
			<h4>Essentially, if you haven't learned by know, she's a control freak that nobody knows muhc about.</h4>
			<h4>Her animimal companion, Pup, is the cutest mix between a shark and puppy. He follows her everywhere sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. He may be small but he is fierce. (Pup's art is based off the comic series "Shark Puppy" by VRESS)</h4>
