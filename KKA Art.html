				<h4 class="centered">The majority of my art consists of single-subject illustrations, by which I mean single-subject drawings that do not include any backgrounds / are not full compositions. The following collection is less of a collection, and more so just all of the illustrations of mine that do not belong in any specific collection.</h4>

			<h5 class="centered">"The Astronaut"</h5>
			<h4>I’ve got a strange love of outer space. Now, I say strange because I’m not really interested in any scientific topics. Yet, I still love the idea of space. I drew this little astronaut as an homage to the way space intrigues me.</h4>

			<h4>I don’t have too much to say about this one; it really is just a standard wizard’s hat. In all honesty, though, it might be just a little bit based off of the Sorting Hat from J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter universe. But, mainly, I just wanted to draw a pointy little hat.</h4>

			<h4>This one really isn’t anything more than just a drawing of the moon. I guess it’s just another one for the love of space. There’s no real reason for the color, but it does remind me of that old children’s tale that the moon is made of cheese.</h4>

			<h5 class="centered">"Blue"</h5>
			<h4>In High School I was tasked with a project my teacher called “Join the Cannon of Art.” The idea behind this project was that students would study art and then learn to find what their own art style is. For my final project, I paired this piece with a piece entitled “Elephants Rule the World” both of which used a swirling pattern to highlight a distinct part of the animal. For my first animal I choose a sea turtle, because I grew up by ocean. To me, I feel like a turtle’s shell is the most defining feature, so that’s the part which I choose to highlight.</h4>

			<h5 class="centered">"Elephants Rule the World"</h5>
			<h4>I created this piece in tandem with the piece above, “Blue.” Both of these were created for a High School project about discovering your own art style. For this second piece I choose an elephant because they are one of my favorite animals; something about them makes me feel peaceful. There are many defining features of an elephant, but I choose to highlight the tusks because they are the most valuable feature of an elephant.</h4>

		<h3 class="centered">Six Collection.</h3>
			<section class="cent">
				<h4 class="centered">The art in this collection is inspired by characters from "Six: The Musical." "Six: The Musical" is a stage musical written and produced by Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow, which premiered in 2017 in the UK. "Six" rose to fame during it's time in London's West End. The show began touring the US in 2019 and was set to debut on Broadway in the summer of 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 Pandemic. "Six" tells the tale of the six wives of King Henry VII: Catherine of Aragon. Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymore, Anna of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Catherine Parr. Playing on the school-house rhyme "Divorced. Beheaded. Died. Divorced. Beheaded. Survived." we see these six wives reincarnated as pop-stars who tell their side of history. For this collection, I drew each of the six wives based off of the actors and costumes of the original West End cast. You'll notice that they don't have very detailed faces. If you were to ask me why right now, I would say that Lucy and Toby designed this play specifically to have a wide variety of actors and not giving them faces helps perpetuate that idea. However, to be completely honest, when I drew these, I didn't have a reason for not giving them faces; it was just a choice that I made.</h4>

			<img class="floatl" src="Aragon Square.jpg" alt="Catherine of Aragon" width="300">
			<h5 class="centered">"Catherine of Aragon"</h5>
			<h4>Catherine of Aragon was the first wife of King Henry VII, and the first "Divorced" in that schoolhouse rhyme. As the story goes, after meeting Anne Boleyn Henry wanted a divorce, but the Catholic Church at the time didn't allow divorce. This led Henry to break Europe away from the Catholic Church, creating the Church of England. "Six" plays on the fact that, due to her strong Catholic faith, this was extremely distressing for Catherine of Aragon. Catherine is the mother of Henry’s oldest child, Mary.</h4>

			<img class="floatr" src="Boleyn Square.jpg" alt="Anne Boleyn" width="300px">
			<h5 class="centered">"Anne Boleyn"</h5>
			<h4>Anne Boleyn was the second wife of Henry VII. Because of her, Henry left the Catholic Church and established the Church of England. Henry eventually had Anne beheaded for her promiscuity, which, ironically, was what drew Henry to her in the first place. He wrote passages referring to her "green sleeves" a common euphemism for prostitution at the time (and why her costume is green). Although Anne wasn't prostitute, but the daughter of a rich French family. Anne is also known for being the mother of the first Queen Elizabeth. You'll notice that this drawing has less detail than the rest of the Queens. I hope that I can update it to match soon.</h4>

			<img class="floatl" src="Seymour Square.jpg" alt="Jane Seymour" width="300px">
			<h5 class="centered">"Jane Seymour"</h5>
			<h4> Jane Seymour was the third wife of Henry VII. She is referred to as "Died" in the schoolhouse rhyme because she is the only one to have died of natural causes while married to Henry VII. Jane is noted for giving birth to Henry's first son. Some accounts say that Henry would refer to this son as his first child despite having multiple daughters born to his first two wives. Due to her pose, Jane is the drawing with facial features. Despite the fact that this causes a discrepancy in theme, I think it helps catch her personality a lot more than with some of the other queens</h4>

			<img class="floatr" src="Cleves Square.jpg" alt="Anna of Cleves" width="300px">
			<h5 class="centered">"Anna of Cleves"</h5>
			<h4>Anna of Cleves was the fourth wife of Henry VII, and the second to be divorced. According to most versions of the story, Henry ended up divorcing her because she was not as pretty as he thought she would be. Since she was German, they had not met before they had married, and Henry had only seen a painting. "Six" attributes the discrepancies between the wife and the painting to a popular practice of wearing excess make up, heels, corsets, etc. at the time. "Six" also plays up the fact that Anna was the only one of Henry's wives to be royalty herself. I enjoyed working with the colors in this drawing. Especially the brighter red, since it makes those sections of the costume pop.</h4>

			<img class="floatl" src="K Howard Square.jpg" alt="Katherine Howard" width="300px">
			<h5 class="centered">"Katherine Howard"</h5>
			<h4>Katherine Howard was the fifth wife of Henry VII, and the second to be beheaded. Interestingly, Katherine was the cousin of Anne Boleyn, and both were beheaded for their promiscuity. Katherine was the youngest of Henry's wives, and, due to her age, "Six" portrays her promiscuity as immaturity. While “Six” spells her name with a “k” to set her apart from the other Catherines, we don’t know whether or not her name was actually spelled with a “k.” This is because, at the time there was no consistency among written English and records show her name spelled both ways. The tricky part of this drawing was the skirt, which in real-life is made of a see-through vinyl.</h4>

			<h5 class="centered">"Catherine Parr" *Work in Progress*</h5>
			
			<h4>Catherine Parr was the sixth and last wife of Henry VII, and the only who “survived.” She was neither divorced nor killed by Henry before he died, giving her the title of “survived” in that schoolhouse rhyme. This Catherine was the first Queen of England to also have been Queen of Ireland, after Henry named himself King of Ireland. According to “Six” she was also known for her talent for writing. She even wrote a few books. After Henry’s death Catherine went on to marry Thomas Seymour, the brother of Henry’s third wife, Jane.</h4>

			<img class="floatl" src="MG Pigeon Square.jpg" alt="Meta-Gameing Pigeons" width="300px">
			<h5 class="centered">"Meta-Gameing Pigeons"</h5>
			<h4>Inspired By: Critical Role</h4>
			<h4>Critical Role is a live-streamed series where "a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors sit aroung and play Dungeons & Dragons." The inspiration for this drawing comes from the few times the players "meta-game" or, in other words" they do things in-character that they technically can only do out-of-character. When the players meta-game they like to pretend their pigeons. By cooing like pigeons, they can pretend that a random pigeon is giving the other character advice and not player to player. </h4>

			<h4>In High School I was asked to make a piece of art work that emulated my favorite artist. The catch was the subject of the piece had to be modern. I had to answer the question of "if this artist was still alive what would they make?" The artist I choose was Andy Warhol and, basing my piece off of his Marilyn Monroe pieces, I created a screen printing style digital painting of Jennifer Lwarence.</h4>
